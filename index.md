## Solid Data Summer School 2025: Data in Solid-State Chemistry

Join us at the University of Birmingham in summer 2025 for the inaugural **Solid Data Summer School**. This school bridges the gap between data science and solid-state chemistry, equipping post-graduate researchers with the skills needed to excel in a data-centric scientific landscape.

Participants will gain hands-on experience in data management, analysis techniques, and computational tools tailored to solid-state chemistry. Designed with a focus on empowering experimentalists, the summer school integrates foundational lectures on data science with team-based projects that blend computational modeling and experimental data interpretation.

### Key Details
- **When**: 21st-24th July 2025 
- **Where**: University of Birmingham, UK  
- **Cost**: Â£50, including accommodation.

### Course Overview
The **Solid Data Summer School** is a hands-on, project-based program. The course includes introductory lectures, team-based research projects, and networking opportunities.

The Solid Data Summer School is a hands-on, project-based program designed to equip participants with skills in computational modeling and experimental analysis of solid-state materials. The course is structured over four days, combining introductory lectures, team-based research projects, and networking opportunities. There will be some pre-work provided to make sure the participants have the required computational skills to get the most out of the course.

**Day 1**: Optional pre-work clinic to go over outstanding issues, fundamentals of data management, linear algebra, and statistics, followed by a welcome social and poster session.  
**Days 2-4**: Taught components of data-driven techniques as applied to chemical problems in the mornings, followed by work in research teams work on analyzing experimental datasets (e.g., diffraction and spectroscopic data)  
**Evening activities**: A hackathon-style session with pizza, and a conference dinner to foster collaboration.  
**Final day**: Teams present their findings in a conference-style session, discussing methodologies and results.  

### Accessibility & Resources:
All materials are provided in advance and made openly available post-school to ensure inclusivity and continued learning.

### Outcomes:
Participants will gain experience in data analysis, computational techniques, and collaborative research, with a focus on drawing meaningful scientific conclusions from experimental data.
