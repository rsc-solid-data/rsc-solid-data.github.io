## Course Overview

The Solid Data Summer School is a hands-on, project-based program designed to equip participants with skills in data-driven approaches for the analysis of solid-state materials. The course is structured over four days, combining introductory lectures, team-based research projects, and networking opportunities. There will be some pre-work provided to make sure the participants have the required computational skills to get the most out of the course.

### Topics
Participants will learn how to use big data and other computational approaches to improve the analysis of experimental data in solid-state chemistry. Taught sessions will include
- Some fundamental maths behind tools like machine learning,
- Aspects of computation in materials science, including
	- interacting with databases,
	- simulating materials properties
	- data simulation from models that can be compared directly with experiments

### Team projects
The projects are designed to reinforce the lectures through hands-on work with real (and messy!) materials data. You will get to see how to use tools to help with structural characterisation and work with data with a critical and analytical perspective. We will cover areas such as
- Using data-driven methods to tackle research problems
- Understanding model limitations
- Quantifying confidence in your results
We will use datasets involving real world materials research problems. Teams can devise their own approach so you can choose to explore side questions that emerge from the data that are interesting or relevant to your field.
